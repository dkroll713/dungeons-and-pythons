# dungeons-and-pythons

Dungeons and Pythons is a silly text-based rpg based loosely on dungeon-crawlers like Diablo 2, text-based games like Zork, and tabletop rpg's like D&D.

The goal isn't to make an awesome game (though hopefully that happens); the goal is to demonstrate knowledge & proficiency with different elements of the Python programming language.

* subclasses.py - creates functional dictionaries containing places & rooms
* rooms2.py - test module where room concept was first proven
* playerandroom3.py - fully functional dungeon-running module. Dynamically generates dungeon rooms & lets player run to end of each; no monsters, not yet incorporated into separates .py files, & it's very barebones, but it works!!

Wishlist:
* character classes (barbarian, wizard, ranger, cyborg)
  * use of subclasses & superclasses
* items (weapons, potions, gold, tools)
  * interactions between various classes, demonstrates competency in super/sub class programming
* text-based navigation (typing 'go north', 'open door', or 'search chest')
  * game logic, demonstrates ability to write & understand complex code
* ~~dynamically generated dungeons (start at point x, navigate to the end)
  * ~~self-generating instances
  * easy, medium, hard, insane modes
  * stores between dungeons to spend gold in
* a story/campaign
  * demonstrates ability to write proficiently & craft an easily digestible narrative
